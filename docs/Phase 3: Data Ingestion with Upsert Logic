### Phase 3: Data Ingestion with Upsert Logic

**Goal:**
Ingest data from GCS into BigQuery and implement upsert logic.

**Steps:**
1. **External Table Definitions:**
   - Create external tables in BigQuery pointing to the location of each data file in GCS.

2. **Upsert Logic with CREATE OR REPLACE:**
   - Implement upsert logic to handle new data inserts and updates.

**Outcome:**
Data ingested into BigQuery with upsert logic implemented for efficient updates.
